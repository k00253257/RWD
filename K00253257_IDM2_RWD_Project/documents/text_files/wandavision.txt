The WandaVision release date has been announced – and it’s slightly later than we had perhaps anticipated.

Marvel and Disney announced today that WandaVision would arrive on Disney Plus on January 15, 2021. That’s a far cry from what we previously assumed would be a 2020 release date. Not only was that pencilled in on Disney Plus for some time, but returning MCU actor Kat Dennings also indicated that a release this year was likely.

Still, it’s not all bad news. It gives us a slight breather after The Mandalorian season 2 finishes on December 18, while also provides a nice slice of Marvel action until Black Widow heads to cinemas in May 2021.

If you’ve not caught up on what WandaVision is all about then, oh boy, do you have some catching up to do. The WandaVision trailer hints at its sitcom setup – which sees Wanda seemingly create a world of her own making based on television tropes after the death of Vision in Avengers: Infinity War.

Those sitcom stylings have even extended to how the episodes are filmed – with the first Marvel Phase 4 entry actually featuring a live studio audience.

Beyond that, Falcon and The Winter Soldier is heading to Disney’s streaming service later in 2021, while there are several new Marvel TV shows in the works for next year – including Loki and the Hawkeye series.
